Author's code repo: [https://github.com/RexYing/diffpool](https://github.com/RexYing/diffpool)

This folder contains a DGL implementation of the DiffPool model. The first pooling layer is computed with DGL, and following pooling layers are computed with tensorized operation since the pooled graphs are dense.

Dependencies
